#Notes 

We will now compute the correlation functions for any set of $N$ points on an interval $J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ *whose j.p.d.f. is of the form*

$$
P(\lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{n})= C \prod_{j=1}^{N}w(\lambda_{j}) \prod _{1\leq j<k\leq N} |\lambda_{k}-\lambda_{j}|^2
$$

where $w(\lambda )\geq 0$ is a real function such that the integral 

$$
\int_{J} w(\lambda) \lambda^{k}d\lambda
$$

is finite for *any $k$*. $w(\lambda)$ is called a **weighting function**.
